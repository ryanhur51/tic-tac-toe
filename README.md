# tic-tac-toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe engine used to help me understand more about game engines in general, and ideally lead to me creating a chess engine in the future. 

# Dependencies
I used the raylib library as well as the raylib starter code in order to make the visuals.

# Minimax Algorithm 
This program uses the Minimax algorithm, which I implemented and optimized for this project. The algorithm recursively calls a game state, where it returns a value based on how winning or losing the player is. This value is changed based on other factors too such as how deep the recursion goes.  
More information about the algorithm here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/)
